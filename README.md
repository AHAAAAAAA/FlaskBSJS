# Flask-JS-BS

This is my very minimal Flask+JS boilerplate. It has templating, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MaterializeCSS. I use it primarily when I'd like to display some interactive Data/ML charts and visualizations or have the need to rapidly prototype an idea. I don't typically need a DB, User Auth, Form validation etc. for those types of projects; only a server and some quick JS.

# Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
`python app.py`
